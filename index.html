        </ul>
        <p>Some notes on usage:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fluidbox will only work with images whose actual dimensions are larger than the displayed dimension.</li>
        <li>The aspect ratio of the displayed and linked image has to be identical.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Oh Look More Words</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>1.0</strong> (26 January, 2017) &mdash; I'm awesome</li>
        <li><strong>1.1</strong> (26 January, 2017) &mdash; You can be awesome too.</li>
        <li><em>&mdash; Happy new year! &mdash;</em></li>
        <li><strong>1.2</strong> (January 2nd, 2017) &mdash; Lorem dicta molestiae quas dolorem fuga, ea nam Ex repellendus ducimus qui vero vitae! Nisi reiciendis placeat alias nesciunt id repellendus quo Illum quasi maxime dignissimos laudantium commodi nostrum Ir</li>
        <li><strong>1.3</strong> (January 4th, 2017) &mdash; I FORGOT TO EAAT LUNCH <code>render.sandwiches()</code> to avoid stupid things being written on websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Basic usage</h2>
        <p>Fluidbox works out of the box as long as you append <code>data-fluidbox</code> to the anchor element, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>In other words, it should look like this: <code>&lt;a href="..." title="..." data-fluidbox&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9OQWB.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9OQWB.jpg" title="" alt="" /></a>
        <hr />
        <h2>Linking to a higher resolution alternative</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it is not feasible to use the actual image itself on the page, due to concerns with excessive bandwidth usage that burdens your server, or encumbers users that are using mobile.</p>
        <a href="http://placehold.it/1500x1500" title="" data-fluidbox><img src="http://placehold.it/200x200" title="" alt="" /></a>
        <p>In this case, you can see that we have used a low resolution thumbnail, which is linked to a higher resolution image (note: both images must be of the same aspect ratio). The script will inevitably make a royal mess of itself if you are using different aspect ratios, but it will not break the page. The aspect ratio will remain the same as that of the thumbnail.</p>
        <a href="http://placehold.it/1500x900" title="" data-fluidbox><img src="http://placehold.it/200x200" title="" alt="" /></a>
        <hr />
        <h2>Versatility</h2>
        <p>Fluid box works even when images are arranged in galleries. In this case, they are arranged with the help of flexbox.</p>
        <p class="message note">The flexbox gallery will collapse into single items when viewed in mobile, or else the thumbnails will be too small &mdash; to appreciate the how Fluidbox works in this scenario, do use a wider device (&gt;600px screen width).</p>
        <div class="gallery">
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uh5YLj5.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox class="col-2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uh5YLj5.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UvGHJjo.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox class="col-2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UvGHJjo.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/esWWGbF.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox class="col-3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/esWWGbF.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZCogT10.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox class="col-3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZCogT10.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/24hrPQn.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox class="col-3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/24hrPQn.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        </div>
        <p>It also intelligently resizes images such that portrait images will fit perfectly within the viewport, although that means scaling down the image:</p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uDPcnM3.jpg" title="" data-fluidbox><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uDPcnM3.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a>
        <hr />
        <p>Moreover, it also works with floated images - to the left or to the right, it does not matter. The following texts are jibberish, used as filler.</p>
        <p class="message note">The floated images will be rendered block-level on narrow-width devices, such as mobile phones. To appreciate how Fluidbox works with floated images, you can view this demo on a wider device (&gt;480px).</p>
